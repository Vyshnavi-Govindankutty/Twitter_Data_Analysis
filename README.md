# Twitter_Data_Analysis

This project was done mainly to explore spark streaming process. 
Tweets related to 100 S&P 500 company stocks were collected using spark streaming for a week and then analysed. 
Tweet sentiments were also analysed and compared against actual stock price market fluctuation that week.
The analysis would give more clearer results if collected for a longer duration.
